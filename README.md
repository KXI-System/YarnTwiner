# YarnTwiner - The Twine format for Yarn

YarnTwiner is a Twine story format that exports your Twine story into a Yarn file, meaning that you can write yarn syntax in Twine and export out a yarn file for use in your YarnSpinner or other Yarn powered projects!

YarnTwiner is **not** not a converter to transform other Twine story formats like Harlowe or Sugarcube into Yarn files, it is a standalone story format with its own syntax and should be treated as such.

YarnTwiner cannot compile or run Yarn files (yet), if you're looking for something to run your yarn files in HTML/JS check out [YarnBound](https://github.com/mnbroatch/yarn-bound). This also means YarnTwiner cannot check if your Yarn file has no errors (yet) so use extra caution.

## Installing

Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/KXI-System/YarnTwiner/releases) section and download the latest release or import the version URL, follow the Twine docs on how to add a [New Story Format](https://twinery.org/cookbook/starting/twine2/storyformat.html#adding-new-story-formats).

Make sure to disable editor extensions for Harlow and Sugarcube (mostly Harlow) that would interfere with YarnTwiner.

## Features

### Yarn Syntax

Write your story in Yarn syntax in the Twine editor, add tags, change the node name and layout, write commands like `<<if>>` or `<<jump>>`. It will automagically get converted over into a Yarn File, no fuss needed.

### Use Twine Links

Twine `[[links]]` will get converted into Yarn `<<jump>>` commands, so you can still have node arrows that show your story flow and automatic new nodes when typing Twine links without giving up Yarn support. **Note:** links with `|` or `<-` `->` are not supported.

### Add in Custom Node Headers

Start a Twine tag with a `&` character and you can add in a Yarn node header easily! So a tag of `&tracking:true` will give you a `tracking: true` header in your Yarn node, no need to edit your files afterwards.

### Make Yarn Files!

The output is real genuine Yarn files, that means anything that can open or run them can use them! YarnTwiner even preserves the positions of your nodes in Twine so that tools like the VSCode extension graph preview can use them ase well, its all in the Yarn ecosystem.

Check out the [Docs](DOCS.md) for more details on everything YarnTwiner has to offer.

## Building

Assuming a Node.js installation, run `npm install` to install the prerequisites then `npm run build` to create a `yarntwiner_latest.js` file.
